# Biomodels Converted to COMBINE Archives

This directory contains a selection of Biomodel SBML files converted into COMBINE archives. Simulation information in the form of SED-ML was added to these archives.

* `borisov2009.omex` derived from [BIOMD0000000223](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main/BIOMD0000000223)
* `wolf2001.omex` derived from [BIOMD0000000090](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main/BIOMD0000000090)
* `wolf2001-oxy-only.omex` derived from `wolf2001.omex` with a change to SED-ML controlling which variables are plotted. Only the oxygen species is plotted. Otherwise identical.
