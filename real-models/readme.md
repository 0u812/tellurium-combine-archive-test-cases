# Real Models

This directory contains examples of using Tellurium to edit real biological models (as opposed to the purely technical examples in the `demos` directory).

* `wolf-hill-study.omex` derived from [wolf2001.omex](https://github.com/0u812/tellurium-combine-archive-test-cases/blob/master/biomodels/wolf2001.omex) by varying a parameter.
* `calzone-fig1-fig3.omex` derived from [this archive](https://github.com/SemsProject/CombineArchiveShowCase) by using Tellurium to generate additional plots corresponding to additional figures in Calzone et al.
* `calzone-feedback-study.omex` derived from [this archive](https://github.com/SemsProject/CombineArchiveShowCase) by using Tellurium to study the effect of feedback control.
